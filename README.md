When searching Google images for an Arduino Nano pinout, one of the images really stood out to me in terms of quality. 
[This image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arduino-nano-pinout.png) seems to have been posted somewhere on
www.bq.com but it was nowhere to be found on that site. After a lot of exploring I found the website 
https://diwo.bq.com/ and using the Wayback Machine I was able to get the original PDF of the file. According to the 
website the schematics were made by Alberto Piganti. There were also pinouts of some other boards. In one of the
comments by the author there was a link to his website http://www.pighixxx.com, which is not available on the web 
anymore, but it is in the 
[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180209105214/http://www.pighixxx.com/test/portfolio_category/boards/).
Some of the PDFs are archived as well so I was able to download them, and others seem to not have been archived, so
there are only images available.

The goal of this repository is to preserve all of these schematics in their original vector form. I will try to track
down the ones not archived.
